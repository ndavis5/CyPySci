I need to parse a bunch of annoatations off of a bunch of sets of trees:
+ First, I will load in the tree along which the data were simulated
+ Then, I will write a function that pulls the annotations (node ages) off of this tree and sets them as headers in a dataframe)
+ Then, I will pull annotations off of the trees estimated from the datasets simulated along those trees. 
+ I will clone the database. One database will store the bottom of the HPD for each node in the column headed by the true value. One will store the maximum.
+ I need to run this five times.
+ I also need to fix my storage. I am not organized
